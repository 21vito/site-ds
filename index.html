            <blockquote>
                "In the Age of Ancients, the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray crags, Archtrees and Everlasting Dragons.
                But then there was fire, and with fire came disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, and of course, light and dark.
                Then from the dark, they came, and found the Souls of Lords within the flame.
                Nito, the first of the dead,
                the Witch of Izalith, and her Daughters of Chaos,
                Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful knights,
                and the furtive pygmy, so easily forgotten.
                "With the Strength of Lords, they challenged the Dragons.
                Gwyn's mighty bolts peeled apart their stone scales.
                The Witches weaved great firestorms.
                Nito unleashed a miasma of death and disease.
                And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own, and the Dragons were no more.
                "Thus began the Age of Fire. But soon, the flames will fade, and only Dark will remain.
                Even now, there are only embers, and man sees not light, but only endless nights.
                And amongst the living are seen, carriers of the accursed Darksign."
                "Yes, indeed. The Darksign brands the Undead.
                And in this land, the Undead are corralled and led to the north,
                where they are locked away, to await the end of the world.
                ... This is your fate."

            <p>The world of Dark Souls is a world of cycles. Kingdoms rise and fall, ages come and go, and even time can end and restart as the flame fades and is renewed. These cycles are linked to the First Flame, a mysterious manifestation of life that divides and defines separate states such as heat and cold, or life and death. As the First Flame fades, these differences also begin to fade, such as life and death having little distinction, and humans becoming Undead. The onset of an Age of Dark, the time when the First Flame has fully died, is marked by endless nights, rampant undeath, time, space, and reality breaking down, lands collapsing and converging on one another, people mutating into monsters, darkness covering the world, and the Gods losing their power. To avoid this and prolong the Age of Fire, the bearer of a powerful soul must "link" themselves to the First Flame, becoming the fuel for another age. If this is not done, the First Flame will eventually die, and an Age of Dark will begin.</p>

            <p> The powerful Lord Souls were taken from the First Flame, used to defeat the dragons, and then to establish kingdoms. Souls are inextricably (and inexplicably) linked to fire. Souls are life, and life is fire; it stands to reason that souls are fire, as well. Without the First Flame and without souls, there is no life. The bearer of a strong soul, called a Lord, who links themselves to the First Flame, is thus rekindling the flames with their own soul, returning life to it. In the end, one could expect that all souls will have been returned to the First Flame, and the Age of Fire will have effectively ended anyways.</p>
